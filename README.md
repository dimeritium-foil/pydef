# pydef
A simple CLI python script that queries the Oxford dictionary API for the definition of a word.

**Dependencies:**
* `python-requests`

  note: It's a dependency of `pip`, so you probably have it installed already.

**TODO:**
* Make an install script.
* Add support for different APIs, like Merriam Webster's API for example.
* Add support for rhymes using Datamuse's API.
